# thunderstorm-sublime-theme

Introducing Thunderstorm - the Sublime Text 3 color scheme for Web Developers.

# Supported Languages

The theme is designed by ensuring the colours are set for base defaults which are inherited by languages not explicitly defined.  

Thunderstorm has been specifically created for and tested against PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript with added support for YAML and XML.

# Recommendations

## Font

Browse the excellent [codeface](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/codeface) for fonts that make your source code look beautiful.

I recommend using one of the following fonts:

- [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro)
- [Anonymous Pro](http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-pro)
- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
- [Ubuntu Mono](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/codeface/tree/master/fonts/ubuntu-mono)


## User Settings

To get the absolute best visuals I recommend the following Sublime Text 3 User Settings:

```
	"caret_style": "phase",
	"font_face": "Source Code Pro",
	"font_options":
	[
		"gray_antialias" // For Retina screens
	],
	"font_size": 15,
	"highlight_line": true,
	"line_padding_bottom": 3,
	"line_padding_top": 3
```

## UI Themes

Thunderstorm works well with the phenomenally awesome [Material Design UI Theme](http://equinusocio.github.io/material-theme/) for Sublime Text 3.
